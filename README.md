Muscle-Memory-Game
==================

Generic muscle memory game played in the browser. This should be familiar to people that have played CS and other FPS games. 

So far the game just includes a practice mode where you just click
freely, and one single super easy and short drill.

I might add more content, but at this point it looks like the stuff
that I add will be uninteresting to program so I might not do it. I
would have to code in new drills, and probably change the colors of
the dots so they look less like crap.
